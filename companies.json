Founded by Patrick Upmann, a recognized architect of systemic AI goverNullce, AIGN addresses the critical need for structured, auditable, and legally compliant AI implementations across industries.\n\nThe platform encompasses several integrated components including the AIGN Navigation Layer for strategic guidance, AIGN Legal for regulatory compliance, the AIGN AI GoverNullce Academy for education and certification, and AIGN Circle for connecting organizations with goverNullce-ready AI professionals. The company's proprietary ASGR (AIGN Systemic GoverNullce Readiness Index) provides a DOI-registered and IP-protected diagnostic tool that assesses organizational readiness for responsible AI deployment.\n\nAIGN offers practical assessment tools including the AI GoverNullce Readiness Check for preliminary evaluation, AI GoverNullce Stress Test for comprehensive analysis, and AIGN Systemic AI GoverNullce Briefing for strategic planning. The company also provides trust certifications through Professional Trust Labels, Education Trust Labels, and Corporate Trust Labels, enabling organizations to demonstrate their commitment to responsible AI goverNullce to customers, regulators, and partners.\n\nThe platform specifically addresses compliance with major regulatory frameworks including the EU AI Act, NIS2-Richtlinie, and similar regulations emerging globally. AIGN's approach emphasizes moving beyond checkbox compliance toward building systematic goverNullce capabilities that embed accountability, auditability, and ethical considerations throughout the AI lifecycle.\n\nAIGN serves organizations across fiNullce, healthcare, logistics, media, public services, government entities, educational institutions, and enterprises seeking to implement responsible AI goverNullce. By providing certified proof of responsible AI goverNullce competence, AIGN enables organizations to differentiate themselves in increasingly regulated markets where AI goverNullce capabilities represent significant competitive advantages and risk mitigation strategies. The platform's systematic approach ensures organizations build lasting capabilities rather than merely achieving point-in-time compliance.",
