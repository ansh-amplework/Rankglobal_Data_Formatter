      "description": "TwelveLabs, Inc. is an AI-first company that has built the first generation of video-native artificial intelligence capable of “seeing” video the way humans do—by interpreting both what is happening in the frame and the surrounding temporal context. At the heart of the platform are two proprietary models: Marengo, a high-capacity encoder that captures fine-grained visual motion and structure, and Pegasus, a video-language model that aligns visual streams with spoken words, on-screen text, and higher-order concepts. Trained on massive, NVIDIA-accelerated GPU clusters, these models achieve benchmark-level accuracy that exceeds many cloud-provider baselines while scaling to petabyte-scale video libraries. The product suite is delivered as a set of easy-to-integrate APIs. The Search API lets developers query any video collection with natural language, returning precise timestamps for moments that match semantic intent across audio, visual, and textual modalities. The Analyze API produces on-demand summaries, transcripts, object inventories, and custom narrative descriptions by prompting the underlying generative model. The Embed API generates dense multimodal vectors for every frame or segment, enabling semantic similarity search, recommendation pipelines, and downstream machine-learning tasks. For enterprises that need domain-specific expertise, TwelveLabs offers a fine-tuning workflow where customers can upload proprietary video data, and the models adapt to industry jargon, brand aesthetics, or security terminology. Deployment flexibility is a core differentiator. TwelveLabs can run in public cloud environments, in isolated private clouds, or on-premise hardware, supporting SSO/SAML and other enterprise security standards. Across industries, TwelveLabs is unlocking new productivity gains. Media houses use the platform to automatically tag footage, locate archival clips, and generate episode-level summaries, cutting editing time dramatically. Advertising agencies analyze video ads in real time to assess brand compliance and audience resonance, feeding insights directly into campaign optimizations. Government agencies accelerate threat detection by instantly surfacing relevant video events from surveillance feeds. Automotive manufacturers index and query millions of test-drive videos to improve perception models for autonomous vehicles.",

      "description": "TrustLayer is a cloud-based risk intelligence platform that applies artificial intelligence to the traditionally manual world of third-party compliance. At its core, the service ingests certificates of insurance, W-9s, contracts and a variety of other risk-related documents, then uses machine-learning models to extract key data points, validate coverage limits, and compare the results against an organization’s predefined risk appetite and industry benchmarks. By processing more than 400,000 COIs each month, TrustLayer can surface coverage gaps, flag non-compliant vendors, and automatically trigger reminder emails or workflow escalations, dramatically reducing the time risk teams spend searching for missing paperwork. The platform is built for risk managers but its workflow touches every stakeholder in the vendor lifecycle. Finance teams rely on TrustLayer to ensure that payments are only released when a supplier meets all insurance requirements, eliminating costly exposures. Executives gain a real-time risk dashboard that consolidates compliance status across thousands of vendors, turning a traditionally defensive function into a strategic asset. Brokers and carriers use a shared, sign-in-free portal to upload and receive compliance documents, improving speed and transparency throughout the underwriting process. TrustLayer’s AI engine is complemented by a suite of automation tools. Users can configure customizable compliance templates for specific industries—construction, real estate, healthcare, commercial lending, events, and more—so that each vendor is asked for the exact documents needed for their line of work. Collaboration is a central design principle. Because TrustLayer treats risk as data, its analytics can identify emerging trends—such as rising gaps in certain coverage types or patterns of non-compliance—allowing risk officers to proactively adjust policies. The platform’s scalability, backed by an extensive network of nearly 300,000 companies, makes it suitable for small businesses as well as large enterprises seeking a unified, AI-driven approach to third-party risk management.",

      "description": "WorkFusion is a leading provider of AI-driven automation for the financial-crime compliance market. Its flagship offering, AI Agents, are purpose-built digital analysts that mimic the decision-making of human compliance specialists. Rather than functioning as a conventional screening tool that merely flags suspicious activity, these agents actively review each alert, apply Level-1 adjudication logic, and automatically elevate only the genuinely high-risk cases for deeper investigation. Every action is captured in an explainable, regulator-ready audit trail, ensuring full transparency and compliance with supervisory expectations. The platform tackles the most painful pain points for banks: overwhelming false-positive volumes, costly manual triage, and the need to constantly scale teams to match transaction growth. By deploying AI Agents across key compliance domains—AML, sanctions & PEP screening, adverse-media monitoring, transaction screening, and KYC—WorkFusion enables organizations to process alerts in seconds, achieving up to 95% straight-through processing (STP) when enhanced with Generative AI. The GenAI layer enriches narrative generation, produces detailed case notes, and dramatically reduces human-written documentation errors. WorkFusion’s solution is built on a blend of advanced technologies. Machine-learning models are trained on domain-specific data to recognize patterns of illicit behavior, while natural-language processing extracts actionable insights from unstructured news feeds and adverse-media sources. Document AI capabilities automate data extraction from KYC forms and onboarding paperwork, feeding structured information directly into compliance workflows. Explainable AI modules surface the reasoning behind each decision, aligning with regulatory-mandated model risk management (MRM) frameworks. Clients—ranging from ten of the world’s top twenty banks to leading regional institutions—report measurable gains: double-digit efficiency improvements, halved labor costs, and a substantial reduction in audit findings.",

      "description": "Upwind Security delivers a cloud-native application protection platform (CNAPP) that secures cloud infrastructure, workloads, configurations, and applications in real time. Leveraging an agentless, eBPF-based runtime fabric, Upwind provides continuous visibility of network, API, and data flows, automatically surfaces exploitable risks, and prioritises remediation based on actual usage. At its core is a lightweight eBPF sensor that streams telemetry from every cloud workload—containers, serverless functions, virtual machines, and APIs—without requiring agents or heavy instrumentation. This sensor feeds a continuously updated graph into Upwind’s AI engine, which applies machine-learning models to detect anomalous behavior, privilege misuse, and exploit attempts the moment they surface. Upwind’s “AI Runtime Security” (also marketed as GenAI Security) extends this intelligence to guard generative-AI workloads, identifying model-drift, data-exfiltration, and prompt-injection attacks that are invisible to traditional scanners. Customers benefit from a single pane of glass that visualises their entire cloud estate, ranks risks by actual usage impact, and automates remediation through integrated workflow bots. The solution’s agentless architecture enables rapid deployment—often in under 30 minutes across dozens of accounts—earning praise from DevOps teams for its speed and from security leaders for its depth of insight. Upwind’s integrations span the major public clouds (AWS, Azure, GCP) and popular DevOps toolchains, allowing organizations to embed security directly into their development pipelines. In practice, Upwind helps enterprises reduce alert fatigue, accelerate compliance certification, and shrink the window between detection and response from days to minutes. By marrying real-time telemetry with AI-driven analytics, the platform not only uncovers hidden vulnerabilities but also predicts where attackers are most likely to strike next.",

      "description": "Vellum positions itself at the intersection of large-language-model intelligence and everyday operational productivity. Recognizing that most enterprises spend countless hours on repetitive “boring” tasks—data pulling, report generation, compliance checks, and content drafting—Vellum offers a platform where those tasks can be re-imagined as autonomous AI agents. Users simply type a natural-language instruction, such as “Create a weekly roadmap capacity report from Notion and Linear,” and Vellum instantly composes a workflow: it authenticates to the relevant APIs, fetches the data, runs LLM-driven analysis, formats the results, and delivers them to Slack, Notion or any chosen endpoint. The platform’s core is a library of reusable “nodes” that encapsulate actions and a graph-based orchestrator that defines the order of execution. Under the hood, Vellum leverages OpenAI’s GPT models for reasoning, text generation, and classification, while integrating with over a thousand third-party SaaS tools—including Google Workspace, Notion, Salesforce, Stripe, HubSpot, Linear, and PostHog. This breadth of connectivity enables truly cross-application automation, turning siloed data into actionable insights without custom code. Vellum agents serve a wide variety of business functions. Product teams can automatically assess roadmap feasibility by combining issue tracking data with capacity metrics. Marketing departments can generate SEO-optimized articles by researching top-ranking pages and drafting polished content. Finance operations benefit from fraud detection agents that ingest transaction streams and apply LLM pattern checks. Legal teams can automate contract and NDA reviews, scoring risk and outputting redlined suggestions. The platform’s value proposition is its “no-code yet extensible” approach: non-technical users can automate complex, multi-step processes, while engineers can dive into the generated Python code for fine-tuning. By abstracting LLM prompting, API authentication, and orchestration, Vellum accelerates AI adoption across departments that traditionally lack data-science resources.",

      "description": "ViSenze, now part of Rezolve AI, has positioned itself at the forefront of AI-driven commerce by delivering a unified multimodal discovery engine that merges visual and textual intelligence into a single, seamless shopper experience. At its core lies a decade-long trained AI model that has processed hundreds of millions of product images, enabling high-precision visual search that can recognize items from any angle, style or context within milliseconds. Coupled with cutting-edge large language models, ViSenze’s AI Text Search interprets natural language queries, while the Shopping Assistant layer adds a conversational interface, allowing users to ask “What should I wear with this dress?” and receive instant, curated suggestions. The platform’s Multi-Search capability lets shoppers blend modalities—typing a keyword, uploading an image, or selecting a social post—all in one query, dramatically reducing friction and driving higher conversion rates. Behind the scenes, a suite of recommendation engines—Visually Similar, Pairing Suggestions, Shop the Look, and “Recommend Me”—leverages both computer-vision similarity metrics and collaborative filtering to surface the most relevant products at the right moment. For retailers, the Experience Studio provides drag-and-drop widgets and SDKs that can be embedded into any web or mobile front-end, enabling rapid deployment without deep technical overhead. ViSenze also tackles the operational bottleneck of manual product tagging through its GenAI Smart Tagging service. By automatically generating rich, SEO-friendly tags at scale, brands improve catalog discoverability across all search channels. Trusted by industry leaders such as Myntra, Zalora, Target, and Meesho, ViSenze’s solutions have demonstrably lifted average order values by double-digit percentages and increased click-through rates by up to 20% within weeks of implementation.",

      "description": "VisibleThread positions itself as a strategic AI-first partner for organizations that must respond to complex, high-stakes solicitations such as government RFPs, SOWs, and contracts. Leveraging more than 15 years of experience in “sensitive bids,” the company has built a unified platform that stitches together every step of the proposal lifecycle into a single, evidence-grounded workflow. At the core of the solution is a suite of AI-driven capabilities that transform traditionally manual processes into fast, repeatable actions. The platform begins with opportunity qualification, automatically shredding source documents into searchable requirements. Using Document AI and natural-language processing, VisibleThread surfaces relevant past performance data, highlights mandatory clauses, and flags high-risk language such as non-standard data-rights or security terms. The AI then scores the opportunity, providing a data-backed “bid/no-bid” recommendation. During proposal creation, AI content generation assists authors by suggesting compliant language, auto-completing sections, and ensuring a consistent tone. Integrated acronym and watchword management prevents inconsistent terminology, while automated compliance matrix building eliminates tedious manual work. All changes are fully traceable, creating an immutable thread that links every piece of content back to its original source requirement. Collaboration is built into the platform, allowing teams to work concurrently in a centralized repository and share AI prompts. The solution also supports secure deployment models—including GovCloud, on-premises, and SCIF—to comply with stringent standards such as SOC 2, CMMC, and NIST. VisibleThread’s customer base spans top government contractors like Parker Hannifin Aerospace and Moog Inc., reporting faster turnaround times and higher win rates through intelligent document automation.",

      "description": "VoiceIntel is a niche consultancy that specializes in delivering fractional sales and revenue-operations leadership to fledgling artificial-intelligence companies, primarily those whose products serve the contact-center ecosystem. Founded by Kirk Owen, the firm positions itself as a bridge between cutting-edge AI innovators and the complex sales processes required to win enterprise contracts in a highly regulated, data-intensive environment. Rather than building AI models themselves, VoiceIntel’s core value proposition lies in its deep understanding of both AI technology and the sales dynamics of the contact-center market. The service model is part-time and outcome-driven: clients receive a senior-level executive who integrates directly with their internal teams, crafts go-to-market (GTM) plans, establishes robust sales pipelines, and activates strategic partnerships. By operating on a fractional basis, VoiceIntel enables startups to tap into seasoned sales expertise without the financial burden of hiring a full-time VP of Sales. The consultancy’s toolkit revolves around industry-standard CRM and engagement platforms such as Salesforce, HubSpot, and Salesloft, helping clients select the optimal stack and configure workflows for data-driven decision making. A hallmark of VoiceIntel’s approach is partnership engineering. The firm maintains an extensive network of technology and consulting partners—including AWS, Genesys, IBM, and Accenture—allowing AI startups to fast-track integrations and co-sell opportunities. Target customers are typically early-stage AI firms that have built a prototype or minimum viable product (MVP) but lack the internal sales engine to convert that technology into revenue. By aligning sales strategy with product roadmap, VoiceIntel helps these startups achieve key milestones such as first logo acquisition and series-A fundraising traction.",
