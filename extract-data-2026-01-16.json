      "description": "Indium Software is a global digital-engineering firm that delivers end-to-end technology solutions across application engineering, cloud engineering, data and analytics, and digital assurance. Within this broader portfolio, Indium has launched teX.ai, a SaaS-based text-analytics platform designed to turn unstructured, high-volume textual content into structured, actionable insight. teX.ai tackles three core challenges: extracting tabular data from PDFs and scanned documents, summarizing key information, and classifying large corpora of text. The product eliminates the need for manual template creation by employing deep-learning models that automatically detect table regions, perform OCR, and output clean tabular datasets. Simultaneously, its sequential natural-language-processing pipelines identify entities such as batch numbers, issue dates, and other domain-specific attributes regardless of their position in the source document. Advanced topic-modeling and sentiment analysis modules surface the main themes and key phrases from customer reviews, support tickets, and complaint logs. teX.ai's value proposition is framed around reducing time for table extraction, accelerating insight generation from free-text feedback, and streamlining content categorization. The platform is positioned as a plug-and-play solution for firms that possess large text repositories—ranging from financial research houses with dense research reports to B2C brands that monitor user reviews and support interactions. By integrating cutting-edge deep-learning, computer-vision OCR, and natural language understanding, teX.ai exemplifies Indium Software’s broader mission to make advanced AI technologies accessible, scalable, and directly tied to business outcomes.",
